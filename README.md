# DCCInspection

This repository contains the iOS implementation of a Digital Corona Certificate inspector used in the context of the EU Digital Corona Certificate for use in the [verifier](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-ios) and [wallet](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-wallet-app-ios) app. This inspector offers blueprints to the verifier and wallet app which allows it to be able to scan, verify and store Digital Corona Certificates.
